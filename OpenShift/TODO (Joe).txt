TODO:

-Allow the user to zoom in on the calendar to be more specific with time periods
-Allow changing months on the calendar without reloading the page
-Allow for business hours after midnight
	NOTE: Right now, daily business hours must be one continuous time period that can't span past midnight.
	      The only workaround now would be to start the business hours of the next day at midnight
-Implement a 12-hour mode in the calendar
