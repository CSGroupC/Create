TODO:

BACK->FRONT DATA:

Availability.aspx:

1. The start of the current user's business' working hours
2. The end of the current user's business' working hours

FRONT->BACK DATA:

1. (CREATE) new availability time period for the current user
2. (UPDATE) availability time period


FEATURES:

-Implement a 12-hour mode in the calendar
-Allow changing months on the calendar without reloading the page
-Allow for business hours after midnight
	NOTE: Right now, daily business hours must be one continuous time period that can't span past midnight.
	      The only workaround now would be to start the business hours of the next day at midnight
